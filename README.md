# MKS22X-ProcessingYeet
Pairs: Joseph and Angel, Grace and Sophie

Features:

- BeachBalls bounce off the wall by the law of incidence
- BeachBalls bounce off of rocks and off of other BeachBalls
- EarthBalls move by the force of gravity with a user-controllable parameter of air-resistance
- Click an empty space to create an EarthBall
- Click an EarthBall to make it jump (recommend clicking on the EarthBalls that has stopped bouncing. If you try to click on a fast moving   Earthball, you'll probably miss, creating an EarthBall and it'll get messy if you keep on doing that)
- The LivingRock follows wherever your mouse is

General:
- Joseph made the ball movements for both BBall and Earth Ball, and fixed several major bugs such as balls getting stuck in many different   places and overlapping ball co-ordinates in the setup
- Angel worked on both displays(), helped integrate code and fix little things heavily in the beginning when grace and sophie were out for   AP stuff, and created the bounce-when-collide-on-rock feature for Bball
- Sophie helped work on livingrock move(), helped in Collideable, fixed a bug in Earthball movement, and created the create-more-Earthballs     when-mouse-pressed feature
- Grace worked on Collideable, made the EarthBalls-jump-when-clicked feature, and made the BBalls-bounce-off-of-other-BBalls feature

May 6:
- the work was split to 4 people (because of APs and such, we later deviated from initial plans)
May 7:
- Today, as sophie and grace are out from APs me and angel will start the work together
May 8:
- Sophie: made living rock follow the mouse and tried to start collideable interface
- Joseph: started more complicated ball moves()
May 10:
- Joseph: Finished BBall and Earthball moves()
May 11:
- Grace: completed collideable interface, made balls turn red when they collide with rocks
May 12:
- Sophie: fixed problem with living rock shaking and getting stuck on sides of screen, fixed problem with earth ball going off screen, made more earthBalls appear when you click
- Joseph: tweaked Earthball for more user-control and aesthetics, fixed several major bugs
- Grace: made BBalls collide and bounce of each other, created a way to let user click on Earthballs to make them bounce up again
