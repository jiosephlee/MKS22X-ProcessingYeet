# MKS22X-ProcessingYeet
Pairs: Joseph and Angel, Grace and Sophie
General:
- Joseph made the ball movements for both BBall and Earth Ball, and fixed several major bugs such as balls getting stuck in many different   places and overlapping ball co-ordinates in the setup
- Angel worked on both displays(), helped integrate code and fix little things heavily in the beginning when grace and sophie were out for   AP stuff, and created the bounce-when-collide-on-rock feature for Bball
- Sophie helped work on livingrock move(), helped in Collideable, fixed a bug in Earthball movement, and created the create-more-Earthballs     when-mouse-pressed feature
- Grace worked on Collideable, made the EarthBalls-jump-when-clicked feature, and made the BBalls-bounce-off-of-other-BBalls feature

May 6:
- the work was split to 4 people (because of APs and such, we later deviated from initial plans)
May 7:
- Today, as sophie and grace are out from APs 
- Angel: ball move and merge conflicts
- Joseph: helped make ball move within boundaries
May 8:
- Sophie: made living rock follow the mouse and tried to start collideable interface
- Joseph: started more complicated ball moves()
- Angel : changed ball and earthball display and modified some movement method things
May 9:
- Angel: worked on living rock movement and made the rock display random
- Joseph: worked on gravity ball
May 10:
- Joseph: Finished BBall and Earthball moves()
May 11:
- Grace: completed collideable interface, made balls turn red when they collide with rocks
May 12:
- Sophie: fixed problem with living rock shaking and getting stuck on sides of screen, fixed problem with earth ball going off screen, made more earthBalls appear when you click
- Joseph: tweaked Earthball for more user-control and aesthetics, fixed several major bugs
- Grace: made BBalls collide and bounce of each other, created a way to let user click on Earthballs to make them bounce up again
- Angel: fixed the rock dsiplay so it would actually load, made the code generate both subclasses of ball, modified ball movement so it would bounce off the rocks and changed the eye postion on the living rock
